    <h3>Year: 2023</h3>
    <h4>Medium: Oil paint on canvas</h4>
    <h4>Scale: 8 x 10 inches / 20 x 24 inches</h4>
    <h5>In this artistic endeavor, I present a diptych of oil paintings, each a reflection of a same experience: my quiet wanderings within the halls of a museum. The lower painting is an exercise in realism, an earnest attempt to capture the tangible essence of the scene as my eyes perceived it. In contrast, the upper painting delves into the intangible, encapsulating the melancholy and tranquility that resonated within my soul during these blue explorations.</h5>
    <h5>Through these works, I strive to bridge the chasm between the world as it appears to me and the world as it is. It is an exploration of perception versus reality, a study in how my internal landscapes color my view of the external. This project is a first foray into juxtaposing these two realms, seeking to render visible the often invisible interplay between the emotional and the physical, the seen and the felt. </h5>
