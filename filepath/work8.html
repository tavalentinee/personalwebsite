    <h5>In the lingering summer of Hangzhou, where gentle breezes play a tender dance with slanted willow branches, poetry is in motion, a symphony of nature's subtle rhythms. With its soft shimmer, the river mirrors the vibrancy of the grass flourishing under the sunlight.</h5>
    <h5>Half of my heart rejoices in the serene beauty that unfolds before my eyes, while the other half is tinged with a melancholic undertone, dreading the emptiness as the holiday draws close. During these bittersweet intervals, I realized the meaning of "carpe diem," for it is in these fleeting moments that the essence of life truly resides.</h5>
